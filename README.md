# Gantt Chart Implementation in C
#### Software Engineering Project 2 (Mar 2023 - Apr 2023)
Second project for software engineering project 1 module in 1st year. Worked with a teammate to product a gantt chart implementation in C.
The gantt chart is modifiable by the enduser and has the ability to list as well as test dependencies and alert the enduser to any loops present.
The entire chart is rendered via the terminal using ASCII characters and dynamically adjusts itself to ensure uniformity by a collection of padding functions.
